PinPointer: An Android App to Find Your Way

How many times have we parked our car in a large parking lot on the way to some place, and on
return found it hard to locate the exact spot? How many times have a few of us decided before-hand
on meeting at a specific intersection and later had to scramble to find each other since each had a
slightly different view of the intersection? Chances are that you have. The goal of the app
is to alleivate such concerns.
Pinpointer serves as an all-purpose location recorder and navigator.  With Pinpointer, the user 
(with an Android phone and Pinpointer installed) will be able to record the exact location of a 
meeting space of car park, and navigate to that spot with ease. One can also communicate the 
exact location of a meeting to friends without ambiguity.
